# gesture_control_bot
I worte this code for my college project where i had to control a bot over wifi using hand gestures.
I used python flask to create localhost server which is used to stream the integers from the return.txt 
Return.txt file holds the integer value or simply the no.of fingers raised.
To count the number of fingers i used opencv library and wrote a code in python.
